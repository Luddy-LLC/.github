# Welcome to the Luddy LLC GitHub!
We're the Luddy Living Learning Center, a residential community for first-year techies at Indiana University. We're a close-knit and engaged group of students interested in technology. Many of us are part of the Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering... but a number also are non-Luddy majors interested in tech! The LLC is an amazing place to live, and if you're looking in to joining IU as a first year student, we encourage you to join the LLC! 

## About the LLC GitHub

This is our Luddy LLC GitHub, home to a number of student-lead projects. We first started as a place to collaborate and host the Luddy LLC Mega Puzzle 2024 event, and we're so excited to keep expanding. Have a brilliant idea? We'd love to collab
